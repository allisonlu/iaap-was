## Notes

principle -> guidelines -> success criterion

4 principles of a11y:
1. **perceivable** - info + interface must be presented to users in ways they can perceive (i.e. not invisible to all of their senses) 
2. **operable** - interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform
3. **understandable** - content or operation cannot be beyond user's understand 
4. **robust** - content should be interpreted reliably by various user agents and ATs (and as technologies advance)

### Guidelines

#### Perceivable
1.1 Text alternatives
- 1.1.1 provide **text alternatives** for non-text content 
  - electronic text is presentation neutral => can be rendered visually, auditorily, tactilely, or combination (aka whatever form fits best for user's needs)

1.2 provide alternatives for **time-based media** 

- 1.2.3 **audio description or Media alternative (prerecorded)** 
  - audio description: provide info (during pauses in dialogue) about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text 
  - media alternative: provide info in text form, will probably read like a screenplay or book
- 1.2.4 **captions (live)** 
  - responsibility falls on content providers (callers) or "host" caller, not application
- 1.2.6 **sign language (live)** 
  - responsibility falls on content providers (callers) or "host" caller, not application
